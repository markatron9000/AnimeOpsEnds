# AnimeOpsEnds
A project that will, given a username for https://myanimelist.net/, download a .txt file containing youtube URL's for the openings all of the user's finished anime. There is not a public MyAnimeList API (that I know of), so I send a request to the site and manually scrape the finished anime list. Has an extremely simple GUI.<br />
